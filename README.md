# Project 4 - Cat Clinic

Hi there , this project is using Ruby On Rails to create a CRUD App. The theme that i chose is related to cats clinic

Technologies that i used:- For this project , the primary language was Ruby, the framework Ruby on Rails, Postgresql.

Approaches that i took in making the application.

For making these app, my thought process was to include a function where users will be able to create an account and make an appointment respective to the account.

Challenges that i faced in making the application.

I consider this as a work in progress , so thanks for sharing your time.
