# Project 4 - Cat Clinic

Hi there , this project is using Ruby On Rails to create a CRUD App. The theme that i chose is related to cats clinic

Technologies that i used:- For this project , the primary language was Ruby, the framework Ruby on Rails, Postgresql.

Approaches that i took in making the application.

For making these app, my thought process was to include a function where users will be able to create an account and make an appointment respective to the account. By doing this, the email that the user uses to register will receive an email to confirm account and appointment creation.

Challenges that i faced in making the application.

Working with rails database to me is quite challenging as the models must have relationships

I consider this as a work in progress , so thanks for sharing your time.
